## What

I'm working on Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. for now. And eager to contribute OSS more, so to make my work on public, I created the place to write something I thought/created/learned.

## Image and movie sample

The following picture is Shibazakura at [Hitsujiyama][hitsujiyama] Park, Hitsuji means the sheep in Japanese, and its park has real sheeps.

## Code Sample

### main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

### main.cpp

```c++
#include <cstdio>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, C++!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### main.ts

```c++
const anExampleVariable = "Hello TS!"
console.log(anExampleVariable)
```

## Epilogue

End.
